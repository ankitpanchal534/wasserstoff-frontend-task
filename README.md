   ## Approach

   I approached this project by closely following the design provided in Figma. I utilized Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure that the colors, typography, and layout matched the design as closely as possible. Additionally, I implemented all user interactions and animations to replicate the Figma design. The code is well-structured, readable, and commented to enhance maintainability and readability.
